# wabde-widget-PublicNotification

This is widget is derived from a widget provided by Esri.

Description from manifest.json:
Public Notification allows staff to identify properties within a given
distance (buffer) of a subject property and generate mailing labels
and/or a structured text file of owners and occupants that fall within
the buffer. This application is typically used by local planning and
zoning officials, but can be used by any agency looking to notify
property owners and occupants of a formal action being taken.

It will be included as a submodule along with others in 
[Wildsong/wabde-widgets](https://github.com/Wildsong/wabde-widgets).
